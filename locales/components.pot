This means that longer keys will need to come into use in the foreseeable future. Assuming a usage period of five years, is is already necessary to generate longer keys. However, longer RSA keys with 3072 bit or 4096 bit are significantly slower. For this reason the new Nitrokey Storage 2 and Pro 2 (resp. the integrated OpenPGP Card version 3.3) supports encryption by means of `elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography>`__.

Even if there is no evidence of back doors in the curves, using a certain curve can pose a question of trust. Fortunately the new Nitrokey Storage 2 and Pro 2 support two kind of curves, namely NIST and Brainpool. In what follows we will use Brainpool curves. `This article <https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/>`__ provides a good entry point for gaining a general understanding of elliptic-curve cryptography."
